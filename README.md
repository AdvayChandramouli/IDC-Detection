# Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Detection using Machine Learning

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent subtype, making accurate detection crucial for patient outcomes. Traditional methods rely heavily on pathologists analyzing histopathology slides, which can be time-consuming and subjective. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to automate the classification of breast histopathology images as IDC-positive or IDC-negative.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and install required dependencies with pip.

```bash
  pip install -r IDC-Requirements.txt
```


    
## Usage/Examples
- **Run the notebooks:**
    Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code).

- **Examine the results:**
    Each notebook contains detailed explanations and markdown to guide you through the steps, including data preparation, training, evaluation, and visualizations of model performance. You can run the cells sequentially to reproduce the results. Our results are attached under Project Artifacts, on this repo. 

- **Modify for your use case:**
    Adapt model parameters to suit different training scenarios and datasets.


## Future Directions

- **Experiment with Different Architectures**
    
    Explore diverse CNN architectures and optimize hyperparameters to identify a model that balances accuracy and efficiency

- **Implement Transfer Learning**

    Leverage pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet50 to utilize learned features from larger datasets, fine-tuning them for IDC detection to improve accuracy and reduce training time
